Apply to questions 1 - 5:
Generate a bowtie2 index of the wu_0_A genome using bowtie2-build, with the prefix 'wu_0'.

$bowtie2 --version
>version 2.3.4.1
>64-bit

$mkdir wu_0
$bowtie2-build wu_0.v7.fas wu_0/wu_0
$ls

#1 How many sequences were in the genome?
$grep -c "^>" wu_0.v7.fas

#2 What was the name of the third sequence in the genome file? Give the name only, without the ">" sign.
$cat wu_0.v7.fas | grep '>' | more
>Chr1

#3 What was the name of the last sequence in the genome file? Give the name only, without the ¡§>¡¨ sign.
grep ¡§^>¡¨ wu_0.v7.fas | tail -1

#4 How many index files did the operation create?
# recall the result from #1
>6 


#5 What is the 3-character extension for the index files created?
>bt2
or
$ls wu_0/

¡°Apply to questions 6 - 14:
Run bowtie2 to align the reads to the genome, under two scenarios: 
first, to report only full-length matches of the reads; 
and second, to allow partial (local) matches. 
All other parameters are as set by default.



#6 How many reads were in the original fastq file?

#10 How many reads were mapped in the scenario in Question 8?
